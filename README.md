A Jupyter Notebook telling the story of my first wikipedia web-crawler. Using NLP techniques and TF-IDF to summarise the articles.

# wiki-crawler
This is my attempt at an exercise posed to me through the MSc Data Science course I am enrolled in.
It asks to create a web scraper that can analyse the text data.

This is in no way production-ready code, but simply a walk through analysis.

By completing this exercise I developed my understanding of core python programming as well as using libraries such as NLTK and Pandas.
